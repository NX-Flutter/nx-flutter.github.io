I’m incredibly excited to welcome Flutter into the official set of Material Design Components as a full fledged peer to our Android, iOS and Web offerings. Flutter’s philosophy of flexible and adaptable widgets is a great fit for Material Theming, and Flutter’s ability for real time UI iteration is a game changer in the way we polish and refine designs.
